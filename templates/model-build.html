      The data set used for our model contains a detailed play-by-play account
      of every single play ran over the course of 10 season. It contains,
      geographical and date information, the type of play that was called, the
      number of yeards gained from said play, down, clock and field positioning,
      among others. It also contains offensive stats on each player directly
      involved in the play, such as passing and rushing yards, yards ran after a
      catch, etc, and defensive stats, such as fumbles and interceptions, and of
      course play outcome, e.g. touchdown, field goal, etc.
    </p>

  <p>
    In order to create a model that can predict which play is the likeliest to
    be called, we resonned that any information relating the the state prior to
    calling the play would be critical in informing the decision to run a pass
    or a run play, or alternatively to kick a field goal or punt. We limited our
    predictions to either pass or run plays for several reasons:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">
      Kickoffs were removed as they only occur at the beginning of the game/half
      or after a scoring drive. Decisions don't factor in other then the type of
      kick, e.g. long, short or onside kick.
    </li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">
      Edge cases, such as QB kneel or spiking where also dropped as these
      decisions are fairly obvious given a specific set of circumstances.
    </li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">
      Punts and field goals typically occur on 4th down and the decisions to run
      either play is largely determined by field positioning
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Our next task was to choose the features which, as discussed above, would be
    predicted to influence play calling.
  </p>

  <h4>Intrinsic Features</h4>
  <p>
    The goal of a play is to gain as many yards as possible, 10 at a minimum,
    generally over the course of 3 downs. As such we would expect down and
    distance to go to be critical in deciding which play to call. Passes
    typically net more yards, but short distances are typically easier to obtain
    running the ball. Time remaining in the game and the score differential are
    also a crucial considerations. Finally, we reasoned that field positioning
    could be important, but largely dependent on other factors, such as time
    remaining and the number of time outs a team possesses, which we also
    excluded as a feature. We settled on the following features:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">
      Time remaining in the game
    </li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">
      Time remaining in the half
    </li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Field position</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Score differential</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">
      Yards to go to a 1st down or touchdown
    </li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Current Down</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Extrinsic Features</h4>
  <p>
    As discussed earlier, weather plays a critical part in decidinf which play
    to call. For example, under heavy rains or strong winds, loss of grip and
    visibility may favor running plays. We sought out to detemine whether
    weather conditions could improve our learning model. The following game time
    weather parameters were included:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Temperature</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Precipitation (amount)</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Snow (amount)</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Wind speeds</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Visibility</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Humidity</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h4>Algorithm</h4>
  <p>
    Our decision to limit the play types reduced this to a classification: Given a set of pre-existing game and weather conditions, what is the predicted play call. After cleaning and aggregating the data, we ran multiple algorithms:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Logistic Regression</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Bagging meta-estimator</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">AdaBoost</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">XGBoost</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Decision Tree</li>
    <li class="features" style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Random Forest</li>
  </ul>
