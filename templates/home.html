  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In the National Football League (NFL), being able to accurately predict
    which play your oppent will call given a set of circumstances would be an
    invaluable tool, and teams devote many resources towards gaining insights
    into an opponent’s tendencies on the field. One area of immense interest is
    assessing a team’s propensity to run or pass the ball in a given situation,
    which for a defense can inform critical decision-making about strategy,
    personnel, and positioning on the field – decisions that have a profound
    impact on the outcome of a game.

    In this project, we take a data-driven approach to classifying offensive
    play types and examine whether tools from machine learning can offer value
    in characterizing offensive tendencies.

      Much of the work on this topic stems from operations research and
      economics communities as researchers sought ways to determine optimal
      play-calling strategies through the frameworks of game theory and decision
      analysis. This line of inquiry was formally introduced in 1978 by Carter
      and Machol[1] in their seminal paper outlining optimal fourth-down
      strategies. These studies were later extended by Boronico and Newbert[2]
      to include goal-line situations and ultimately all plays by Jordan, et
      al.[3]. We sought to further extend on this topic by including an
      important factor in decision-making in sports, specifically outdoor
      sports, namaly weather.

    Indeed, weather can significantly influence how a coach will call a play:
    Downfield passing and receiving plays are the most affected by the weather
    conditions. Heavy rains can cause visibility issues for both the quarterback
    and the receiver, affect grip resulting in players fumbling the ball when
    attempting to receive a pass in rain. Strong winds can alter ball
    trajectory, resulting in more interceptions. Because running back are the
    most "waterproof" players, offense can ofter continue to run the ball when
    passing plays are compromised by conditions.

    While our work focuses on predicting what play a team will run given a set
    of conditions, as opposed to what a team ought to do, the foundation
    established in these early papers in identifying the most critical
    situational statistics for play-calling decisions proved valuable to us in
    selecting features for our algorithms.
