# Using Machine Learning to Predict NFL Stat Leaders: Top passers, rushers and receivers

![][image-1]

##### Which receiver will lead the league in catches in a given season? What about the running back who will have the most rushing yards? Or which quarterback will have the most touchdown passes?

Can past performance be predictor of future performance? We decided to take a machine learning approach to answer that question.

#### Resources:

1. **Detailed NFL Play-by-Play Data 2009-2018** : The [dataset][1] made available on Kaggle contains all the regular season plays from the 2009-2016 NFL seasons. The dataset has 356,768 rows and 100 columns. Each play is broken down into great detail containing information on: game situation, players involved, results, and advanced metrics such as expected point and win probability values. Detailed information about the dataset can be found at the following web page, along with more NFL data: https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data.

2. **Historical weather data**:
